# Mixotrophic Nanoflagellate Physiological response to Increasing Microplastic Contamination

Measured response metrics (primary production, bacterivory, growth) of Ochromonas BG IV to increasing microplastic contamination over a 1 week exposure period.

There are 3 main scripts. 
mixo_mp_Rcode.R is the first iteration/attempt at quantifying the amount of PP from mixotrohy. I would disregard this script and is deprecated. 

Second, PP_first_try.Rmd contains all of the attempts of primary production estimation for not only this project but several others as separate code chunks.
In the long term I hope to parse out the chunks that are not associated with the project, which in hindsight is not the best. I will have several copies of
this code in different repositories as it remains relevant to multiple projects.

Third, Stats_workshop_final.R is the script that does everything the second script does for this project only and includes mixed effect/generalized additive
modelling to evaluate the impact microplastics have on the mixotrophic ochromonas sp.
